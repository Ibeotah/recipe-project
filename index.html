      <h1>Jollof Beans and Plantain</h1>
      <p>
        Jollof beans and plantain is a popular West African dish that combines
        two distinct but complementary foods. It's a staple in many households,
        particularly in Nigeria. The dish typically consists of beans that are
        cooked in a savory, spiced tomato and pepper stew, similar to the base
        of jollof rice. The addition of
        <strong>fried sweet plantain</strong> elevates the dish, providing a
        delightful contrast of textures and a subtle sweetness that balances the
        savory, spicy stew. It is a hearty and satisfying one-pot meal often
        enjoyed for lunch or dinner.

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Soak and boil the beans:</strong> Rinse the beans and soak
          them in water for at least 30 minutes. Drain and place them in a pot
          with fresh water. Boil until the beans are soft but not mushy. Drain
          and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prepare the pepper mix:</strong> Blend the tomatoes, red bell
          peppers, scotch bonnet pepper, and half of the onion until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sauté the aromatics:</strong> Heat the palm oil in a separate
          pot. Add the remaining chopped onion and sauté until translucent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cook the stew base:</strong> Pour the blended pepper mix into
          the pot with the palm oil. Add the stock cubes and a pinch of salt.
          Cook on medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the stew has
          thickened and the oil has settled on top. This should take about 15-20
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Combine the beans and stew:</strong> Add the cooked beans to
          the stew. If using, add smoked fish or meat at this point. Stir well
          to combine, add a little water if needed, and let it simmer for 10-15
          minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fry the plantain:</strong> While the beans are simmering,
          slice the ripe plantain and fry in a separate pan with vegetable oil
          until golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the jollof beans hot, garnished with the
          fried plantain.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Tips</h2>
      <p>
        For an <u>extra creamy</u> texture, you can mash a portion of the cooked
        beans before adding them to the stew. This helps to thicken the dish
        naturally. Using <mark>palm oil</mark> is traditional and gives the dish
        its authentic flavor, but you can substitute it with vegetable oil if
        necessary.
